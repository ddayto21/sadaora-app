/**
 * Middleware to verify user authentication.
 *
 * This function checks if a user is logged in by looking for a token
 * (stored as a cookie) in the incoming request. If a valid token is found,
 * it confirms the user's identity and allows them to access protected features.
 * If not, the request is blocked and a 401 Unauthorized error is returned.
 *
 * Ultimately, this middleware serves as a front gateâ€”only letting in users
 * who are safely signed in.
